The Taskbar Support Library allows better system integration with the [Bliss-x86](https://github.com/BlissRoms-x86) Android distro for PCs.

Currently, the library's only function is to enable Taskbar as a launcher option on first boot of Bliss-x86.  It may be updated in the future to support more functionality as needed by the Bliss-x86 project.
