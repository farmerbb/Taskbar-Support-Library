The Taskbar Support Library allows better system integration with the [Bliss OS](https://blissroms.com) Android distro for PCs.

Currently, the library's only function is to enable Taskbar as a launcher option on first boot of Bliss OS.  It may be updated in the future to support more functionality as needed by the Bliss OS project.
