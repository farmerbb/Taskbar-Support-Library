The Taskbar Support Library allows better system integration with the [Bliss OS](https://blissroms.com) Android distribution for PCs.

Currently, the library's functions are:

* Enable Taskbar as a launcher option on first boot of Bliss OS
* Show or hide the navigation bar by adjusting overscan

Taskbar Support Library may be updated in the future to support more functionality as needed by the Bliss OS project.
